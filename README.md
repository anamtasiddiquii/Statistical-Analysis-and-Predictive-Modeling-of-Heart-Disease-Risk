# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction System

A Machine Learning web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The application is built with **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**, providing an interactive interface for users to enter patient health information and receive instant predictions.

## 📌 Features

- Predicts heart disease risk using a trained SVM model
- Interactive and user-friendly Streamlit interface
- Real-time prediction with confidence score
- One-hot encoded categorical features for accurate predictions
- Trained using Scikit-learn
- Model saved using Pickle for deployment

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Pickle
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Input Features

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Serum Cholesterol

## 🤖 Machine Learning Workflow

1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. One-hot encoding of categorical variables
3. Train-test split
4. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
5. Model training with Support Vector Machine (SVM)
6. Model evaluation
7. Deployment using Streamlit
